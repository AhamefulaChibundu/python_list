# LIST

This repo shows basic things you could do in python list.. below are the steps I followed after creating a python file named `list.py`:
1. Create an empty list called my_list.

2. Append the following elements to my_list: 10, 20, 30, 40.

3. Insert the value 15 at the second position in the list.

4. Extend my_list with another list: [50, 60, 70].

5. Remove the last element from my_list.

6. Sort my_list in ascending order.

7. Find and print the index of the value 30 in my_list
